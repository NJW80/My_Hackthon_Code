# My_Hackthon_Code
My code from the data hackathon workshop sessions

Initial Jupyter Notebook is from a data hackathon workshop hosted by count.co in London on 20th Feb 2019. The workshop was based on space data. 

Count.co provided some Jupyter Notebooks with some initial code to get started. The notebooks here clearly label what code was provided by count.co and what code was written by me

The notebooks are:
1. Astronauts Analysis.ipynb - This data looks at some data about US astronuats. It contains data such as name, date of birth, universities attended, branch of military, number & duration of space flights, number & duration of space walks. This is a fairly basic notebook with basic challenges

Data files are:
astronauts_raw_data.csv - This contains the raw data for the Astronauts analysis
